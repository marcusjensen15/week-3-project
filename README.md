#### By _Marcus Jensen_

## Description

_This application takes a numerical input from the user, and responds with comma separated values counting up to or down from that number (as specified by selecting 'forwards' or 'backwards' by the user). Numbers containing a 1 are replaced with "Beep!", numbers containing a 2 are replaced with "Boop!", and numbers containing a 3 are replaced with "I'm sorry Dave, I'm afraid I can't do that.". If the user's inputed number is divisible evenly by 3, the returned message when the application encounters a 3 in the string will replace "Dave" with the users inputted name._
